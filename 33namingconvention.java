//naming convention in java :- makes code readable and understandable.


// Camel casing:-

//  class and interface - Calc , Runnable :-start with capital letter

//variable and method - marks , show() :- start with lowercase
//constants - PIE, BRAND :- all capital

//showMyMarks() = method
//MyData = class
//Human() = constructor [ because H is capital so it is like class and it is method because of braces, hence it is constructor]

- Naming Convention Rules in Java
- Camel casing in Java
- What is Sanke casing?
- Advantages of naming convention


#1
Naming Convention Rules:-
A naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.
- A class name should start with a capital letter.
e.g.,  public class Calc
- Variable names and methods start from a small letter
e.g.,  marks, show()
- Interface also starts with capital letters.
e.g.,  Runnable
- Constants have all letters capitalized of a word.
e.g.,  PIE, BRAND
- Packages contains lowercase letters. Multiple words can be joined by using the dot(.).
e.g., java.util, java.lang

#2
Camel Casing:- We combine words as the first letter of every word should be in uppercase. 
e.g.,  HelloWorld, MyFirstClass
- Mostly Java developers work on camel casing.

Snake Casing:- We combine different words using an underscore (_) in between them.
e.g.,  Hello_world, my_first_class

#3
Advantages of the naming convention:-
- These conventions make the code more readable.
- It helps us to distinguish between different things.
